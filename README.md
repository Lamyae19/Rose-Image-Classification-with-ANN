# Rose Image Classification using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
This project focuses on building a binary image classification system that determines whether a given image contains a rose or not. It uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to process and classify images based on extracted features. The system is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of roses and non-roses.

üîß Technologies Used:
* Python
* TensorFlow / Keras (for building the ANN)
* NumPy, Pandas (for data processing)
* Matplotlib (for visualization)

üß† How It Works:
1. Data Collection: A dataset of rose and non-rose images is collected and labeled accordingly.

2. Preprocessing: Images are resized, normalized, and converted to grayscale or RGB as needed.

3. Model Design: An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is built with input, hidden, and output layers to learn image features.

4. Training: The ANN is trained to recognize patterns that differentiate roses from other objects.

5. Evaluation: The model is evaluated using accuracy, loss, precision, and recall metrics.

6. Prediction: New images can be tested to classify them as ‚Äúrose‚Äù or ‚Äúnot a rose‚Äù.

üéØ Goal:
To develop a lightweight, fast, and accurate classifier that can be used in real-world applications such as botany apps, gardening assistants, or visual plant recognition tools.

‚úÖ Output:
* Trained ANN model
* A prediction function that accepts any image and returns: "It's a rose" or "Not a rose"
