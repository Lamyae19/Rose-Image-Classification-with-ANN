# Rose-Image-Classification-with-ANN
This project focuses on building a binary image classification system that determines whether a given image contains a rose or not. It uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to process and classify images based on extracted features. The system is trained on a dataset containing labeled images of roses and non-roses.
